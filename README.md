# Learning Experience
While developing this calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I gained valuable insights and skills in several areas:

## 1. HTML Structure
Building the calculator required a solid understanding of structuring HTML elements. I learned how to organize the layout efficiently to support the functionality and styling.

## 2. CSS Styling
I enhanced my CSS skills by working on the calculator's appearance. This project allowed me to practice styling elements, handling layout, and ensuring a responsive design for different devices.

## 3. JavaScript Logic
Implementing the calculator's functionality was a great exercise in JavaScript programming. I deepened my understanding of handling user input, performing calculations, and managing state within a web application.

## 4. DOM Manipulation
The project provided hands-on experience with Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. I learned how to dynamically update the UI in response to user actions and input.

## 5. Version Control (Git)
Working on this project improved my version control skills using Git. I practiced creating branches, making commits, and managing the repository through GitHub.

## Future Improvements
I plan to continue refining the calculator and exploring additional features. Learning from this project, I aim to apply these skills to more complex web development tasks in the future.
